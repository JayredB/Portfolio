            <hr>      
            <p>
                Allow me to introduce myself, i'm Jayred, a 29 year old, from Middletown, CT. Iv'e worked a wide variety of jobs over the years. From my frist job being a cashier, to aerospace jobs, towing cars to now. I'm currently working as a CNC Machinist
                 looking for a career change to get away from typical "blue collar" job's. What sparked my interest in programming was a friend trying to teach himself python. I like a good challenge and found it interesting. So we both would try to write code
                 in PyCharm. Then came the idea to try and persue careers working with programming. We talked about building apps, websites, learing different languages and freelance work. Plus the idea of having a "remote" work from home job sounded pretty 
                 appealing. Then came the talks about potential salaries. Which I know, you aren't supposed to base your career choice off of. But everyone want's more money if not people would be working for free. But my determining factor was when I started 
                 learning about coding and wrote a little, I actually enjoyed it. I also find the little bit of time I've spent coding to be pretty relaxing and the rewarding feeling of getting a program to run without errors. I know there's day's that wont be 
                 relaxing with this career path. But i'm here for the challenge's, to learn,  and prove to myself I can do this.
