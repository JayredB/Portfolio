            <p>
                Allow me to introduce myself, i'm Jayred, a 29 year old, from Middletown, CT. I'm currently working as a CNC Machinist looking for a career change to get away from typical "blue collar" job's. Iv'e worked a wide variety of jobs over the years. From my
                frist job being a cashier, to aerospace jobs, towing cars to now. I'm currently working as a CNC Machinist looking for a career change to get away from typical "blue collar" job's. What sparked my interest in programming was a friend trying to teach 
                himself python. I like a good challenge and found it interesting. So we both would try to write code in PyCharm. Then came the idea to try and persue careers working with programming. We talked about building apps, websites, learing different languages
                 and freelance work. Plus the idea of having a "remote" work from home job sounded pretty appealing. Then came the talks about potential salaries. Which I know, you aren't supposed to base your career choice off of. But everyone want's more money if not
                people would be working for free. But my determining factor was when I started learning about coding and wrote a little, I actually enjoyed it. I also find the little bit of time I've spent coding to be pretty relaxing and the rewarding feeling of 
                getting a program to run without errors. I know there's day's that wont be relaxing with this career path. But i'm here for the challenge's, to learn,  and prove to myself I can do this.
