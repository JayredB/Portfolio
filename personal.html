        <p id="Personal"> So as I said before im from Middletown, CT. I grew up here most my life. I have a girlfriend named Colette. I have four kids named, Miko, Carter, Savannah, and Onyx. I know people say having kids is hard. But its amazing to watch them grow and 
            discover how to do things for themselves. Their love is truly a blessing and its the main drive behind what keeps me going. In my free time I have a few various hobbies that I use to keep myself sane from stress from work or trying to keep up with my kids.
            I have four kids, so its necessary to have outlets. I love them to death but as you could imagine it's alot. The one hobby that I spend the most time with is based around my PC. I am an  avid gamer. I play alot of FPS(first person shooter) games. But i'll
            play anything that's interesting and holds my attention. I also really enjoy a good movie. Although there haven't been any movies that've caught my attention recently. I like mostly comedy and crime movies. My favorite is definitely 
            "The Town". I am also a pretty big music person. I always have music on while working. The other two things I love, but are bad hobbies to get into are cars and guns. So I have the dynamic trio of expensive hobbies. The last thing, My "hero" image is a 
            picture of Montana. I want to travel there one day. Along with a few other states out west, to see where I eventually want to settle down. I love the way the scenery looks out west. But thats enough about  myself. Thank you for taking the time to get
             to know a little about me.
