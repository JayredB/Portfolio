    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p id="Personal"> So as I said before im from Middletown, CT. I grew up here most my life. I have a girlfriend named Colette. I have four kids named, Miko, Carter, Savannah, and Onyx. I know people say having kids is hard. But its amazing to watch them grow and 
        discover how to do things for themselves. Their love is truly a blessing and its the main drive behind what keeps me going. In my free time I have a few various hobbies that I use to keep myself sane from stress from work or trying to keep up with my kids.
        I have four kids, so its necessary to have outlets. I love them to death but as you could imagine it's alot. The one hobby that I spend the most time with is based around my PC. I am an  avid gamer. I play alot of FPS(first person shooter) games. But i'll
        play anything that's interesting and holds my attention Which. I also really enjoy a good movie although, in my opinion, there haven't been any movies that've caught my attention recently. I like mostly comedy and crime movies. My favorite is definitely 
        "The Town". I am also a pretty big music person. I always have music on while working. The other two things I love, but are bad hobbies to get into are cars and guns. So I have the dynamic trio of expensive hobbies. The last thing, My "hero" image is a 
        picture of Montana. I want to travel there one day, along with a few other states out west. To see where I eventually want to settle down. I love the way the scenery looks out west. But thats enough about  myself. Im looking forward to getting to know the
         rest of you and getting through this with the rest of my classmates. Thank you for taking the time to get to know a little about me.
